        As the fn name suggest it does softmax over the neighborhoods. Example: say we have 5 nodes in a graph.
        Two of them 1, 2 are connected to node 3. If we want to calculate the representation for node 3 we should take
        into account feature vectors of 1, 2 and 3 itself. Since we have scores for edges 1-3, 2-3 and 3-3
        in scores_per_edge variable, this function will calculate attention scores like this: 1-3/(1-3+2-3+3-3)
